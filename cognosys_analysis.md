###  Search for immigration statistics in Germany in 2023 

According to the German federal statistics agency Destatis, the number of people who migrated to Germany in 2022 was higher than in any other year, with approximately 2.67 million people entering the country [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319). This influx resulted in a net gain of 1.46 million people for Germany, as 1.2 million people left the country [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319). The main cause for this increase in immigration was the war in Ukraine, which forced 1.1 million Ukrainian refugees to seek safety in Germany [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319).

In terms of migration from other countries, arrivals from Syria, Afghanistan, and Turkey also increased in 2022 compared to the previous year [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319). Additionally, there was a slight increase in arrivals from other EU countries, with a net gain of 87,000 people compared to 81,000 in 2021 [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319). The main EU countries of origin for migrants coming to Germany were Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319).

On the other hand, the number of people with German citizenship emigrating from the country also increased in 2022, with 83,000 people leaving compared to 64,000 in 2021 [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319). The main destinations for German emigration were Switzerland, Austria, and the United States [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319).

According to data from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), there were approximately 1.1 million arrivals of people from Ukraine in Germany in 2022 [2](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Population/Migration/_node.html). This number represents the influx of Ukrainian refugees who sought safety in Germany due to the war in Ukraine [2](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Population/Migration/_node.html).

The net migration rate for Germany in 2022 was 2.695 per 1000 population, which indicates a decline of 26.45% compared to 2021 [3](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/DEU/germany/net-migration). In 2020, the net migration rate was 4.632 per 1000 population, demonstrating a decline of 17.3% compared to 2019 [3](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/DEU/germany/net-migration).

Furthermore, the population of Germany with a migrant background in 2022 was approximately 23.8 million, accounting for 28.7% of the total population [4](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Population/Migration-Integration/_node.html). This figure includes individuals who either migrated to Germany themselves or were born to two people who moved there [5](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigrants-made-up-over-18-of-2022-population/a-65383249).

In conclusion, in 2022, Germany experienced a significant increase in immigration, primarily driven by the war in Ukraine. The number of people entering the country exceeded the number of people leaving, resulting in a net gain of 1.46 million people. The influx included individuals from Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, and Turkey, as well as other EU countries. Simultaneously, the number of German citizens emigrating from the country also increased. The net migration rate for Germany has fluctuated in recent years, with a decline observed from 2021 to 2022 due to various factors. Overall, a significant portion of Germany's population has a migrant background, indicating the diversity and openness of the country [1](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigration-reaches-record-high-in-2022/a-66042319) [2](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Population/Migration/_node.html) [3](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/DEU/germany/net-migration) [4

### Search for public statements by German political figures about immigration in 2023

In 2023, the topic of immigration in Germany has become a prominent issue for political figures and the general public. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has gained significant support and is now polling at around 17-19% nationwide [1](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-rides-high-anti-immigration-anti-green-agenda-2023-06-07/). The party's rise can be attributed to their strong stance against high levels of immigration and what they perceive as a costly green transition. They have also capitalized on the infighting within Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government, which has further boosted their popularity [1](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-rides-high-anti-immigration-anti-green-agenda-2023-06-07/).

The government of Germany has recognized the need to attract skilled workers from overseas to address the country's shortage of labor. In January 2023, several changes were introduced to immigration laws to facilitate the entry of skilled workers [2](https://resources.envoyglobal.com/global-news-alerts/germany-immigration-law-updates-for-2023/). These changes include the lowering of German language requirements for the spouses of third-country workers and the simplification of the residence permit application process [2](https://resources.envoyglobal.com/global-news-alerts/germany-immigration-law-updates-for-2023/). The government aims to make Germany a more attractive location for third-country nationals and increase skilled labor migration from non-EU countries [4](https://smithstonewalters.com/2023/04/06/germany-to-reform-immigration-laws-to-attract-skilled-workers/).

The German government plans to introduce a new immigration law in 2023 to further enhance the country's attractiveness for skilled workers [3](https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/business/immigration-of-skilled-workers-to-germany-new-law-2023). The proposed law aims to create the "most modern immigration law" in Europe and offers multiple pathways for foreign workers to enter Germany. These pathways include requiring a professional qualification or university degree recognized in Germany, a minimum of two years of relevant work experience, or a new "opportunity card" for individuals who have the potential to find work in Germany [3](https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/business/immigration-of-skilled-workers-to-germany-new-law-2023). The government also plans to make changes to the EU Blue Card to make it more accessible to specialists with relevant job experience, even if they do not possess a university degree [4](https://smithstonewalters.com/2023/04/06/germany-to-reform-immigration-laws-to-attract-skilled-workers/).

These immigration policy changes in Germany aim to meet the country's labor needs and address the shortage of skilled workers. The government recognizes the importance of attracting foreign talent while ensuring the economic success and competitiveness of the country [4](https://smithstonewalters.com/2023/04/06/germany-to-reform-immigration-laws-to-attract-skilled-workers/).

In conclusion, the issue of immigration in Germany has become a significant topic in 2023. The far-right AfD party has gained significant support by opposing high immigration levels and what they perceive as a costly green agenda. Meanwhile, the German government has implemented changes to immigration laws to attract skilled workers from non-EU countries, aiming to address the shortage of labor and make the country more attractive for foreign talent. These changes include lowering language requirements for spouses of third-country workers and simplifying the residence permit application process. The government plans to introduce a new immigration law that offers various pathways for foreign workers to enter Germany, including a focus on professional qualifications, work experience, and potential for employment. These efforts aim to create a modern immigration system and ensure Germany's economic success [1](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-far-right-rides-high-anti-immigration-anti-green-agenda-2023-06-07/) [2](https://resources.envoyglobal.com/global-news-alerts/germany-immigration-law-updates-for-2023/) [3](https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/business/immigration-of-skilled-workers-to-germany-new-law-2023/) [4](https://smithstonewalters.com/2023/04/06/germany-to-reform-immigration-laws-to-attract-skilled-workers/).
